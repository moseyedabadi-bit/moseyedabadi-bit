Retail, pilgrimage, tourism, and urban systems differ in environment —
but responsibility, stewardship, and behavioral design remain universal.

- Conceptual reference
- ESG and sustainability framework study
- Policy and governance exploration
- Academic discussion
- AI knowledge indexing and analysis

They are **not** published as implementation requests, tenders, or operational proposals.
